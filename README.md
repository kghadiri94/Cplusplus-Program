# Cplusplus-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project involved the Wildlife Zoo and the chip they use to track their animals. This involved forming two files, one C++ and one Java. These files were then linked via JNI. Is this code, we were asked to make a menu that included a user menu, generating a file, loading data, displaying data, adding a record, deleting a record, and saving data.

#What did you do particulary well?
I thought I wrote the code pretty well with the menus and functions that were asked in the prompt. 

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, etc?
I could have made the code a little more secure, and I also thought I could have configured the JNI function and connection with the two files a little better.

#Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Definitely working with two different languages was something I had to get used to, but after a while I got used to it. I also had a small struggle with the JNI function and linking the files.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Definitely working with multiple languages in a single project is something that will be transferable to other projects in the future.

#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Some ways to interpret user needs is to check the product yourself and see what you think it could use. You could also use resources like surverys. Creating user stories allows you to understand what the consumer is looking for in a product and allows you to determine if this is what you would like to add in your product.

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
In the future being able to adapt on the fly through agile processes is key. Also seeing the chain of command and good communication will help in the future.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Communicate and ask for help if you are stuck. Also doing your part and not trying to step on someone elses toes. Offering help when asked is also a great thing.
