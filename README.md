# Cplusplus-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project involved the Wildlife Zoo and the chip they use to track their animals. This involved forming two files, one C++ and one Java. These files were then linked via JNI. Is this code, we were asked to make a menu that included a user menu, generating a file, loading data, displaying data, adding a record, deleting a record, and saving data.

#What did you do particulary well?
I thought I wrote the code pretty well with the menus and functions that were asked in the prompt. 

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, etc?
I could have made the code a little more secure, and I also thought I could have configured the JNI function and connection with the two files a little better.

#Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Definitely working with two different languages was something I had to get used to, but after a while I got used to it. I also had a small struggle with the JNI function and linking the files.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Definitely working with multiple languages in a single project is something that will be transferable to other projects in the future.
